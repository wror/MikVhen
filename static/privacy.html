The Mikvah of Washington Heights respects your privacy. When you use our appointment website, we collect:

<ul>
    <li>your phone number</li>
    <li>appointment details (e.g. date, time, prep)</li>
    <li>your intention to pay (we do not collect any actual payment information)</li>
    <li>anything you choose to write in the notes field</li>
</ul>


Important: The appointment website is completely separate from any payment website. We do not collect or store any payment details through this site.

Your appointment information is shared only with our current mikvah attendants and is visible to them until midnight of your appointment day. After that, only our system administrator and Melanie Spoerri, can access it if needed.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

If you have questions, please ask.
